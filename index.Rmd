# Intro

The world runs on energy, and for the last 2 centuries, a major source of the worlds energy has been oil. Historically, it has been an incredibly profitable and necessary industry. Today, oil and gas provide [80%](https://www.energy.gov/articles/economic-impact-oil-and-gas#:~:text=Lower%20energy%20costs%2C%20driven%20by,energy%20in%20the%20United%20States.) of American energy, and provide >12 million American jobs. A similar trend is followed globally, with few exceptions. As a result of the prominence of oil and gas within each nation-state's energy consumption profile, it is a sought after commodity. Many conflicts both historically and currently revolve around, or have implications relating to access to energy resources. A period specific example would be the most recent outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, beginning in February 2022. As a result of the re-kindling of this conflict, many European nations that were formerly served by Russian oil/gas had to find new sources of energy, as it was no longer an option to purchase from Russia given the nation's encroachment upon sovereignty. 

This blog will provide further analysis of the impact that global conflicts have on the movement of energy resources, the price of energy resources, and the subsequent increases of prices for consumers.

## Word Search

To begin our analysis, we sought out articles relating to a series of key words that are relevant to our topic of interest (oil). These articles were found through using a few different key word searches such as: "Israel-Gaza Conflict", "Global Macroeconomic Environment", "Economic Impact of war" and "How war impacts national economies". After performing these searches, we selected articles that had recent publication dates. We took care to include articles from different institutions such as Governments/National Banks, News Media groups, and high ranking individuals in the private sector. 

```{r fig.align="left", out.width="100%"}
Visual1Data <- word_counts |>
  filter(count>25)

ggplot(data = Visual1Data, aes(x = fct_reorder(word, count), y = count, fill = count)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Number of instances",
    title = "The Most Common Words in Documents Relating to War and Economics")+
  theme_minimal()




```
The output of this analysis gave us insight into the sentiment of the media, national governments, as well as the private sector. Obviously, an article from Bloomberg is going to be more likely to contain the words 'inflation' 'market' or 'economy' than an Emily Dickinson Poem, but seeing the other words that also appear in tandem with the aforementioned and viewing the output holistically still gives us a unique takeaway. That is: among all these economy related terms - oil is also a frequent. Thus, doing a deeper dive into how oil/energy fits into the macro environment has the potential to allow us to unearth new trends and make new discoveries.

## Importing & Exporting Nations {.tabset}

The movement of oil across the globe is fascinating. Although some nations have the ability to be energy self-sufficient, much international trade still occurs. One group of nations that is often involved in the trade of oil is known as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or [OPEC](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/23.htm)(OPEC) for short. These nations engage in trade both with each other and with non-member nations. They do so with the goal of stabilizing the oil markets to ensure a consistent supply of petroleum to those who require it. The following visualizations show the volumes of crude oil imported and exported in two different years using spatial data. The units are in 1000s of barrels per day, where 1 barrel is roughly 42 US gallons. 

```{r}
file_path_imports <- "data/CrudeOilImports.xlsx"

file_path_exports <- "data/CrudeOilExports.xlsx"

OilImports <- read_excel(file_path_imports, skip=2) |>
  mutate(across(c(2:44), as.character)) |>

OilExports <- read_excel(file_path_exports, skip=2)|>
  mutate(across(c(2:44), as.character)) |>
  pivot_longer(!Country, names_to = "Year", values_to = "Exports")

#ImportsAndExports <- left_join(OilExports, OilImports, by = 'Exports')

combined_df <- left_join(OilImports, OilExports, by = c("Country", "Year"))|>
  filter(Country!="Others") |>
   mutate(Exports = as.numeric(Exports),
         Imports = as.numeric(Imports),
         Country = ifelse(Country == "United States", "USA", Country),
         Country = ifelse(Country == "United Kingdom", "UK", Country))

  left_join(combined_df, by = c("ID" = "Country")) |>
  mutate(Exports = ifelse(is.na(Exports), 0, Exports), Imports = ifelse(is.na(Imports), 0, Imports))

```


### Oil Imports

Looking at imports allows for one to see which nations rely on energy from other nations. China, India, and parts of western Europe stand out here. The US is a bit of a unique case, as it imports a similar amount of oil as it exports. This is for a multitude of reasons, but can be boiled down simply: even after shipping costs, it is often cheaper to purchase overseas oil than domestically produced oil. 

```{r}
world_import_export_map1 <- world_import_export_map |>
  filter(Year=="2020")

ggplot(world_import_export_map1, aes(geometry=geom, fill = Imports)) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_void() +
  labs(fill = "Imports (1000 b/d)"
       , title = "Global Crude Imports (2020)"
       , caption = "Source: OPEC") +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", direction = -1) 


world_import_export_map2 <- world_import_export_map |>
  filter(Year=="2022")

ggplot(world_import_export_map2, aes(geometry=geom, fill = Imports)) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_void() +
  labs(fill = "Imports (1000 b/d)"
       , title = "Global Crude Imports (2022)"
       , caption = "Source: OPEC") +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", direction = -1) 
```

### Oil Exports

On the exports side, things get more interesting. First, China has almost no exports, and is entirely dependent on other nations to fulfill its energy needs. Russia on the other hand, is a net-exporter (exports-imports). Notably, it appears that the amount of oil Russia exported decreased from 2020 to the year ending Dec-31 2022. A possible cause of this is the trade restrictions put on Russia as a result of their invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022. 
```{r}
world_import_export_map3 <- world_import_export_map |>
  filter(Year=="2020")

ggplot(world_import_export_map3, aes(geometry=geom, fill = Exports)) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_void() +
  labs(fill = "Exports (1000 b/d)"
       , title = "Global Crude Exports (2020)"
       , caption = "Source: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries") +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", direction = -1) 


world_import_export_map4 <- world_import_export_map |>
  filter(Year=="2022")

ggplot(world_import_export_map4, aes(geometry=geom, fill = Exports)) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_void() +
  labs(fill = "Exports (1000 b/d)"
       , title = "Global Crude Exports (2022)"
       , caption = "Source: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries") +

```
[CPI](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) (Consumer Price Index) is the average price paid by a consumer for a "basket" of consumer goods. Here, we are looking at the CPI for a U.S. consumer from 2017-2022. CPI is also used as an indicator for inflation. The purpose of this plot is to provide some context for the further analysis that will be performed. The CPI has increased steadily over time, but we are interested in seeing if in recent years, global conflicts were drivers of that increase. 


## Oil Pricing 

```{r}
oil_pricing_import <- read_excel("data/Oil Pricing.XLSX")



oil_wrangled1 <- oil_pricing_import %>%
  select(date, US_pricing, europe_pricing, month, year)

oil_wrangled1$date <- as.yearmon(oil_wrangled1$date, "%b-%Y")

oil_wrangled1 <- oil_wrangled1 %>%
  drop_na()

events <- data.frame(
  event_date = as.yearmon(c('Feb-2022', 'Mar-2003'), "%b-%Y"),
  event_label = c('Russia-Ukraine War Start', 'Iraq War Start')
)



# ggplot(oil_wrangled1, aes(x = date)) +
#   geom_line(aes(y = US_pricing, color = "US Pricing"), linewidth = 1) +

## Tables

### **DT** package

The [**DT** package](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) is great for making dynamic tables that can be displayed, searched, and filtered by the user without needing an R server or Shiny app!


```{r dt-example, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

OilExports%>%
  select(Country,Year,Exports)|>
  datatable(colnames = c("Country","Year","Exports"),
            filter = 'top',
            options = list(pagelength=10, autoWidth=TRUE))
```

# Customizing your blog design


As a *final* detail **only** if you have time, you can explore options for customizing the style of your blog. By default, we are using the `readthedown` theme from the [**rmdformats** package](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) (see Line 6 of this file if you want to switch out themes).


## Theme
You can use the [**rmdformats** package](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) to play around with some pre-built themes. There are, I'm sure, many many many more similar packages with built in themes, or you can look into how to include a CSS code chunk to customize aspects of a theme.  

Using the **rmdformats** package, you can change the theme itself (Line 6): 

* `rmdformats::readthedown`
* `rmdformats::downcute` 
  * For `downcute` only, you can add a new indented line below Line 6 with the code `downcute_theme: "chaos"` for the `downcute chaos` theme
* `rmdformats::robobook` 
* `rmdformats::material`

You can explore additional YAML options by looking at the [**rmdformats** package](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) page or running, for example, `?rmdformats::readthedown()` to see the help documentation for a particular theme from the package. 

## Synax highlighting

You can also change the code chunk syntax highlighting option (Line 7, `highlight`): 

* `"default"`
* `"tango"`
* `"pygments"`
* `"kate"`
* `"monochrome"`
* `"espresso"`
* `"zenburn"`
* `"haddock"`
* `"textmate"` 
* `NULL` for no syntax highlighting (not recommended)

## Font size, type, and other customization

Further customization requires adding a CSS style file or code chunk or incorporating other development options. Customization beyond the **rmdformats** package should be your lowest and final priority for the project. Ensure your content is fully prepared first.


# References



Typically, references in R Markdown (and LaTeX) files are [incorporated with a BibTeX database](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html) (a .bib file). You can try this approach or  manually include either a numbered or alphabetized list. 

You can list R package citations with the code `citation("packageName")` in the console and then copy (and reformat as needed) the relevant text, e.g.,
```{r}
citation("DT")
```
